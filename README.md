## Description

A simple command line tool to open ugly one-line-not-indented JSON files in a way that you can read them.

By default it the JSON (prettified with Ruby's JSON library) to your standard output. You can also pass the `-o` parameter for it to open the JSON file in your system's default application or text editor for files with the `.json` extension.

It works only on **GNU/Linux** and **Mac OS X** (theoretically).

## Install

```bash
$ gem install ricojson
```

## Usage

Flags:

```
  -f file       Read JSON from specified file.
  -o            Opens the resulting formatted JSON in your default
                text editor.
  -h            Prints help message.
```

### Examples

You can just **display a JSON file** with it:
```bash
$ ricojson -f my-terrible-not-indented-json-file.json
```

Or **pipe a file's content**:
```bash
$ cat other-terrible-not-indented-file.json | ricojson
```

And **display an API's JSON return** value directly from your command line:
```bash
$ curl https://mnav.heroku.com/artworks/62 | ricojson
```

And if you want to see this in your default app/text editor use the
`-o` parameter:
```bash
$ ricojson -o -f my-terrible-not-indented-json-file.json
```
